# DisplayDayPercentage
This is a small program which displays the time of day in percent.
Follow this guide to successfully use the program.
- You can select if the program will also show the time in a normal way and if you want a status bar.
- If you want it to behave like a widget you can **use & edit** the preset. More on that down below.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Only works on Windows.
- The preset file does not work on Windows 11 yet!

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. **Extract Files:** First, extract all files from the archive into a normal folder. Only interact with the extracted files!
2. **Do Not Run:** The file `DisplayDayPercentage.jar` should **never be run directly**. It is the actual program-code.
   - If you accidentally open it, terminate the `Java(TM) Platform SE binary` task via the Task Manager.
   - **Tip:** The Task Manager can be opened quickly using the `CTRL+SHIFT+ESC` shortcut.
3. **Start the Program:** Open **CLICK_ME.bat** to get acquainted with the program. This is the recommended starting point.

### Troubleshooting
- If the progress **stops updating** after configuration, simply focus the window and press any key.

## üîß For Advanced Users
Advanced users can open the **CLICK_ME_Preset.bat** file with a text editor and adjust the program's behavior. There are only **four variables** that need to be changed to configure the preset as desired.

**Have fun! üòÑ**
